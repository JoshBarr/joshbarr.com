This talk (from the Wellington JavaScript meetup) explores how we solved the challenge of coordinating [a major user interface rollout across dozens of apps](https://www.xero.com/blog/2018/11/xeros-new-navigation-simple-beautiful-experience/) in the Xero family.

Heralded as the “biggest change to Xero in years”, the flexible API and scalble service allows our teams to release a navigation change in ten minutes, rather than several months.
