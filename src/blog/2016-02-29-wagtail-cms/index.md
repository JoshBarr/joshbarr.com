Springload transitioned from a home-built CMS to Wagtail around 2015. As part of our commitment to adopting this python-based CMS, we joined the core open source team as maintainers.

The maintainers met in Cape Town for a one week engineering sprint, focused on core UX improvements that would empower a major not-for-profit user of the CMS.
